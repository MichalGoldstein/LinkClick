        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>
            You may already know us from our work in text recognition and file processing. We started with a simple goal:
            to make extracting text and URLs from PDFs and images effortless. We saw the need for a tool that was fast,
            accurate, and easy to use, and we built our platform to fill that gap.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since our launch, we have helped thousands of users convert their files into usable text formats, saving time and effort.

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>

            scanned document, a screenshot, or a PDF, we provide an intuitive tool that gives you clean, accurate results
            with minimal effort. Plus, we offer an option to download extracted text as a .txt file for easy use.
